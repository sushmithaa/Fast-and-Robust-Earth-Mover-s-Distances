# Fast-and-Robust-Earth-Mover-s-Distances
To present a new algorithm for a robust family of Earth Moverâ€™s Distances- EMDs with thresholded ground distances.
Required tools: Matlab, Python.

First download the coral database. It consists of 1000 images classified in to 10 classes. Then filter the dataset using filter.py file which is in Filtering_Dataset. Then the number of images are reduced to 773. 

Now run the following files on matlab
demo_FastEMD1.m (for 1D histograms)
demo_FastEMD2.m (for 3D histograms)
demo_FastEMD3.m (for gray scale images)
demo_FastEMD4.m (for color images)

Experiment1 folder - Contains files to compare our emd algorithm with rubner's algorithm.
